Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
<br>
<br>
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

<br>
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
<br>
<br>
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
